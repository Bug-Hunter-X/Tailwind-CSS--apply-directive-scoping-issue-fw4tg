The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a component's style tag or within a scoped style tag.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly process utility classes that are defined in a parent component or in another file when those classes are not directly in the same scope. This happens because the `@apply` directive operates based on the immediate CSS scope it's in and doesn't inherit or recursively search for classes defined elsewhere. This leads to unexpected styling behavior.

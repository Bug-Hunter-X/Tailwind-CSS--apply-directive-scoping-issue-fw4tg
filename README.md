# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Scoping Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within components. The problem arises from scope limitations, where `@apply` may not correctly apply classes defined in parent components or external files.

## Problem

The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS is powerful for reusing styles, but it has limitations regarding scope. If you define a utility class in a parent component and attempt to apply it within a child component using `@apply`, it might not work as expected. This happens because `@apply` operates on the current CSS scope and does not automatically search for classes in parent or other files.

## Solution

Several solutions can address this scoping issue:

* **Global Utility Classes:** Define the utility class as a global utility class and directly use it without needing `@apply`.
* **Extract to shared file:** Extract the style classes into a separate file and import and use the classes from there.
* **Directly include classes:**  Instead of `@apply`, directly include the class names within the component's style attributes.

This repository provides practical examples of the problem and proposed solutions, helping you navigate this potential pitfall of using `@apply` in your Tailwind CSS projects.
